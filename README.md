## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Earth Observation Scientist  
**Map Impact, United Kingdom**  
*September 2023 ‚Äì Present*

- Led analysis of time series environmental data and satellite imagery to identify key drivers of algal bloom dynamics in UK freshwater systems; findings were recognised with the AGI Award for Environment and Sustainability (2024) and presented to stakeholders through a workshop and at GEOBUSINESS conference 2024.
- Refined habitat condition indicators and interpreted landscape change across the UK for the development of BiodiversityView product.
- Shaped location-based climate risk insights on heat, wildfire, and drought hazards for the development of company‚Äôs climate risk product, focusing on how these risks are visualised and used across infrastructure, policy, and finance sectors.
- Applied machine learning and geospatial techniques across multiple KAUST Beacon Development and Red Sea Global projects, including habitat classification and satellite imagery processing; improved the accuracy and consistency of terrestrial and marine habitat maps used in environmental assessments and technical reporting.

### Decarbonisation Consultant (Intern)  
**Zerogram, United Kingdom**  
*April 2023 ‚Äì August 2023*

- Calculated and analysed Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions for clients, comparing findings with their decarbonisation strategies to assess progress and highlight areas for intervention.
- Delivered data analysis and interpretation for client-facing decarbonisation reports, providing clear, evidence-based insights to inform strategic planning.
- Developed an Excel-based carbon tracking tool for Zerogram and created LinkedIn marketing posts to communicate the company‚Äôs own climate commitments and activities.

### Research Consultant - Remote Sensing  
**CEGIS, Bangladesh**  
*February 2021 ‚Äì December 2021*

- Created digital maps from remote sensing imagery using ArcGIS Desktop to support national-scale environmental and resource management projects.
- Conducted land use classification through digitisation and geospatial analysis, contributing to project outputs used by government and development partners.
- Collaborated with technical teams to ensure accurate spatial data handling and visualisation, supporting timely delivery of maps and reports.

## KEY PROJECTS

### Automated District-level Climate Hazard Mapping for Bangladesh  
*Personal project*  
*2025*

- Developed a fully automated open-source pipeline for spatial hazard mapping at district scale, using ERA5, FABDEM, and Python.
- Automated end-to-end download, processing, scoring, and map generation for rainfall, flood (rainfall + HAND topography), and heatwave hazards (2020‚Äì2024).
- Produced relative hazard scores and maps for all 64 districts; modular workflow enables extension to other hazards (sea level rise, cyclone, etc.).

### Windermere Catchment Analysis  
*Project Lead, Map Impact | Supported by UK Space Agency*  
*September 2023 ‚Äì February 2024*

- Analysed more than 1,500 Sentinel-2 scenes and 180 PlanetScope imagery using Google Earth Engine and Python to monitor algal bloom dynamics.
- Processed over 300 days of human movement data alongside a 5-year time series of climatic variables (including ERA5 data) to uncover drivers of algal bloom formation using statistical relationships.
- Findings informed nutrient management strategies and received wide public and media attention, including coverage by the BBC.

### BiodiversityView ‚Äì Habitat Condition Mapping  
*Contributor, Map Impact*  
*March 2024 ‚Äì Present*

- Refined habitat condition indicators and interpreted landscape change across the UK using spatial analysis and visual interpretation.
- Enhanced spatial data layers for improved usability by refining habitat classifications, integrating additional contextual datasets, and improving visual consistency to support clearer interpretation by end users.
- Outputs supported a nationwide biodiversity monitoring tool used by public and private sector stakeholders.

### Climate Risk Products ‚Äì Location-Based Hazard Insights  
*Contributor, Map Impact*  
*March 2024 ‚Äì Present*

- Worked on the spatial component of Map Impact‚Äôs climate risk product, focusing on heat, wildfire, and drought hazards.
- Improved the presentation of geospatial outputs and location-based insights to support decision-making across infrastructure, policy, and financial sectors.
- Helped align platform content with user needs through clear communication of environmental risk at asset and regional scales.
